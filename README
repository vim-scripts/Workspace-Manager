The workspace plugin allows you to easily access groups of frequently used
files and run any command on a selected set of files from the workspace.

You can create one or more groups in a workspace. Each group can contain
additional sub-groups. The workspace and the groups can contain one or more
filenames.

The contents of a workspace are saved in a user specified file. This allows
you to create multiple workspaces and to load the desired workspace when
needed.

You can run any Vim ex command or an external shell command on a selected
group of files from the workspace.

For more information about using this plugin, after installing the
workspace plugin, use the ":help workspace" command.
